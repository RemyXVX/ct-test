## Setup/Installation Requirements
### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To run the Pizza Parlor project locally, follow these steps:
* Use Chrome web browser for best compatibility.
* Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone http://github.com/RemyXVX/ct-test-climb
```
* Set up a development environment with a prompt and editor to make changes.
<br /> I choose to use [<strong>gitbash</strong>](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  and [<strong>vscode</strong>](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) because I'm broke and compatibltiy
* <strike>Install [<strong>Node</strong>](https://nodejs.org/en) for the required dependencies.</strike> NO MORE OF THAT BS [<strong>VITE</strong>](https://vitejs.dev/) IS LIFE!!
* Once in your favorite EDI or text editor, we will have to run a couple of commands
<br />to get the project running:
```
npm install 
(to install dependences, which is quick af with vite)

npm run build
(never hurts to double check for errors)

npm run dev
(to get that puppy up and running!)
```
* If some odd reason Vite doesn't link youa localhost, it natively goes to:
<br />[http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)
* From there, go ahead and explore the pages!

## Known Bugs
* image sizing, still working out how to make the picture smaller. Also responsiveness when its in mobile, trying to get the overlay image to work with me.
